I’m Patrick, a senior fullstack software engineer at Dr. Fit. I graduated from the University of Virginia’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in May of 2021 with bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.

I mainly program in PHP (plus MySQL, HTML, CSS, JQuery JS) for work and in Python for my personal projects. I am enthusiastic about web technologies and enjoy building out web services. I also dabble in microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32) and the occasional Python machine learning project.

Check out my projects that I post here. Most of my projects are also public on my GitHub.
