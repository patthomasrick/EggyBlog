I’m Patrick, a senior fullstack software engineer at [Hew Health](https://hewhealth.com/). I will be starting as an associate solutions engineer at [C3.ai](https://c3.ai/) in January. I graduated from the [University of Virginia’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://engineering.virginia.edu/) in May of 2021 with bachelor's degrees in [Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) and [Computer Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/electrical-and-computer-engineering).

I mainly program in PHP (plus MySQL, HTML, CSS, JQuery JS) for work and in Python for my personal projects. I am enthusiastic about web technologies and enjoy building out web services. I also dabble in microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32) and the occasional Python machine learning project.

Check out my projects that I post here. Most of my projects are also public on my [GitHub](https://github.com/patthomasrick).
