**TLDR: Old server died for unknown reasons.** If you are still interested in my personal projects, you can find them on my GitHub. Check the sidebar/footer for links.

My personal web services used to be hosted on IONOS, which I still would recommend for low-cost VPS hosting.

Unfortunately, my IONOS VPS silently passed away today, Saturday, July 2nd, 2022. The blog used to be a Ghost server, which I really like as a beautiful, modern alternative to WordPress for blogging.

Since I don't want my domain name to go to waste, I am now fast-tracking my new personal blog which I've been working on. This project is implemented in Next.js, a static site generator that I have been interested in for some time.

I still have a lot of work to do on this website and hope to get my projects posted as well as actually finishing its implementation.
