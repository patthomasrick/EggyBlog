As is the nature of web development, I often have to work with a lot of different databases. Having a good database manager and SQL editor makes working with databases a lot easier. Over time I've tried a lot of different database managers, namely [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), [PHPMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/), [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/), and [Jun Han's MySQL extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.vscode-mysql). While all of the tools have their strengths and weaknesses, I really prefer a lighter-weight editor and that simple to use at the expense of more complex functionality. In short, all I really need to do is be able to connect to a database easily, view a table's data and structure, occasionally inspect things like indices and foreign keys, be able to run SQL queries, and no more.

[Beekeeper Studio](https://www.beekeeperstudio.io/) so far has been my favorite SQL editor to use. It is fast, simple, and looks good. It is also open-source, cross-platform (and is available through some Linux package managers and Snap), and supports multiple database engines. Best of all, it is receiving a lot of active support and development.

I urge you to [check out the project](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/) and test it out. It is a great tool to use for SQL queries, and it is a great addition to my toolbox and perhaps yours too.
