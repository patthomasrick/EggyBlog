A part of the University of Virginia's Web Programming Languages (CS 4640) curriculum is a semester-long project involving the complete front-to-back design of a website. This process starts at the conceptualization and high-level design of the website's features and ends at a modern website implementation of a responsive Angular frontend that communicates with a PHP/MySQL backend.

My website is a simple task organizing website intended for power users. All task information is initially entered through the quick add bar, which infers various properties about the task such as category (indicated with a hashtag) and due date (inferred by special keywords like `today` or `due on`). These tasks can then be further modified once created for greater control over task information. The frontend asynchronously communicates with the backend, meaning that there are no page loads between user actions and that the general user experience is fluid and continuous.
